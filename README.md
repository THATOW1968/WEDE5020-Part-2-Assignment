- I used a consistent naming convention for your stylesheet.
Established a Base Style:
- I sat default styles for your entire website, such as font family, font size, colour scheme, and margin/padding.
- I used a CSS reset to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
Applyed Typography Styles:
- I used CSS properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, and `letter-spacing` to style text elements.
- I considered using typography scales to create harmonious typography
Created a Layout Structure:
  • I used CSS layout techniques like CSS Grid or Flexbox to structure your content.
  • I defined the layout for your desktop version, ensuring it's clear and easy to navigate.
  • I used CSS properties like `display`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `grid-template-areas` to create complex layouts.
Applyed Visual Styles:
  • I used CSS properties like `color`, `background-color`, `border`, and `box-shadow` to style elements visually.
- I used CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active` to create interactive elements
